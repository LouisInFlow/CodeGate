# CodeGate

---

CodeGate is an open-source [Feature Flag](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html) library focused on productivity. Use it anywhere Javascript or Typescript is written. Our API minimizes context switching through:

- Configuration-in-code for easy referencing, versioning and collaboration. Never leave developer environment.
- Declarative gating model, maximizing re-usability and understandability of gating logic.
- Promise based for flexibility and easy rule making. Can utilize any Javascript/Typescript features and libraries in custom logic.
